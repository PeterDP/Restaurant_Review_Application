Foodplate - A restaurant review website

This web application helps users locate their favorite diners, eateries and pastry shops thorugh a very simple user interface. The user can click on a restaurant and find out the reviews and ratings of the restaurant. In addition, one can also create an account and leave their own rating and review on the website.

The user is also given the option to quickly browse to a given restaurant by using the search box given in the top of the home page. For faster retrieval of search results, I have applied elastic search here.

To help users locate the restaurants, I have used Google Maps API in the restaurant show page. 

The images of the restaurants are stored in Amazon AWS/S3 cloud for a faster load of images in production environment. The application is deployed in Heroku.
